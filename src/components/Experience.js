        Thanks to my friend N'dri for letting me work on different projects when I was just starting.
        During our time together we completed many tasks, from easy to difficulty. <br/>
        I put about nine-months of time reworking the website to more modern looking website.
        I've learned a ton of skills while I was working. These are all the project I've touched on,
        for clients, and for business opportunities.
